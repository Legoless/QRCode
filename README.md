# QRCode

QRCode is an educational project meant for inspection and analysis of the QRCode generation standard. It features complete implementation of generation of QRCode, with the exception of masking evaluation, step by step debugging, data inspection and configurable parameters. The application does not need any additional libraries and is built with modular approach with clearly divided steps. The algorithm works in real time for small QRCodes, but needs up to few seconds to generate bigger QRCodes (version 10 and up). It supports alphanumeric mode and manual selection of the masking function (the ISO mask calculation is not included).
